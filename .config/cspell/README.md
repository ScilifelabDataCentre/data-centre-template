# Spell checking with CSpell

## What is CSpell?

<!--
- what it does
- en-gb but it does not flag all american spellings due to... plus also the other dicts include american spellings
- links
- possibly why this is a good choice?

## Files in this setup

This template uses one GitHub Actions workflow file and one CSpell configuration directory. The configuration files are kept in `.config/cspell` instead of the repository root to keep the repository structured and make the template as easy as possible to use out of the box.

| `.config/cspell/cspell-config.yml` | CSpell configuration file used by the workflow. Defines languages, dictionaries, ignored patterns and project-specific word lists. |

## How this setup works

The workflow explicitly includes some default action settings. The workflow would work the same way without these settings being present, but including them increases clarity and reduces the risk of confusion.

- The spell check runs when a PR is opened or updated
- The workflow is configured to check changed files in the PR
  - `incremental_files_only: true` tells CSpell to only check the PR diff, meaning files changed in the PR. It does not check the rest of the repository.
  - `files: ''` tells CSpell to check all file types selected by the action. This is the _default_.
- The CSpell action uses `.config/cspell/cspell-config.yml` for language, dictionary, ignored patterns, and project-specific-word settings.
  - `language` configures the languages used during the spell check, here British English and Swedish
  - `import` imports dictionaries that need to be installed in the workflow before CSpell runs, in this case Swedish and People Names
  - `caseSensitive` allows CSpell to distinguish between different casing, e.g. SciLifeLab and scilifelab.
  - `dictionaries` list dictionaries from the [`cspell-dicts` repository](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts#cspell-dicts) that do not require installation before use. They are bundled with CSpell and are enabled when listed under the `dictionaries` section
  - `dictionaryDefinitions` imports the custom `project-specific-words.txt` as a dictionary. These are words that are not included in any other [CSpell-available dictionary](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts#cspell-dicts) but that we consider correct and CSpell should not flag.
  - `ignoreRegExpList` tells CSpell to ignore specific patterns
- If CSpell finds spelling issues, the workflow fails. Spelling issues are reported as GitHub annotations, and suggestions are shown when available.

## What to do when CSpell flags a correct word

<!-- 
What to do if Cspell flags a word that you know is correct:
1. Check if Cspell has a dictionary to import
npx cspell trace --config .config/cspell.json [word]
2. If there's an asterisk (*) next to a dictionary, add the 
-->

### 1. Check whether a dictionary already covers the word

### 2. Add a dictionary if appropriate

### 3. Add the word to project-specific words if no dictionary covers it
